## Style Guidelines:

- A dark color scheme suitable for an AI/Tech professional. Primary actions and important information use a deep, energetic tech blue (#5282E0) that evokes intelligence and reliability. The background is a sophisticated dark desaturated blue-gray (#192234) providing a clean canvas. A bright, light greenish-cyan (#99E6D9) serves as an accent, drawing attention to interactive elements and highlights without overwhelming the main content.
- Headlines utilize 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, slightly technical feel, aligning with the AI Engineer persona. Body text and longer descriptions use 'Inter' (sans-serif), ensuring excellent readability and a contemporary, professional look across all content.
- Adopt a set of minimalist, sharp line icons that align with modern tech aesthetics. Icons should intuitively represent concepts like projects, skills, contact, and AI features, maintaining visual clarity and simplicity.
- Implement a clean, well-structured single-page layout with distinct sections for professional summary, experience, projects, and skills. Prioritize generous white space, balanced element placement, and a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing across all devices.
- Incorporate subtle, tasteful animations for interactive elements such as project cards on hover, section transitions during scrolling, and form submission feedback. These animations should be fluid and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
